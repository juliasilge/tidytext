\title{Bind the term frequency and inverse document frequency of a tidy text
dataset to the dataset}
\usage{
bind_tf_idf(tbl, term, document, n)
}
\arguments{
\item{tbl}{A tidy text dataset with one-row-per-term-per-document}

\item{term}{Column containing terms as string or symbol}

\item{document}{Column containing document IDs as string or symbol}

\item{n}{Column containing document-term counts as string or symbol}
}
\description{
Calculate and bind the term frequency and inverse document frequency of a
tidy text dataset, along with the product, tf-idf, to the dataset. Each of
these values are added as columns. This function supports non-standard
evaluation through the tidyeval framework.
}
\details{
The arguments \code{term}, \code{document}, and \code{n}
are passed by expression and support \link[rlang]{quasiquotation};
you can unquote strings and symbols.

If the dataset is grouped, the groups are ignored but are
retained.

The dataset must have exactly one row per document-term combination
for this to work.
