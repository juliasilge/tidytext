You can see a lot, just by looking. 
--- Yogi Berra 

Did you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness? 
--- Lewis Carroll, the Dormouse, in Alice in Wonderland 

The critical requirement of an effective graphical display is that it 
stimulate spontaneous perceptions of *structure* in data. 
--- S. Smith et al. 1990 

Like good writing, producing an effective graphical display requires an 
understanding of *purpose*---*what* is to be communicated, and to 
*whom*. 
--- Michael Friendly, "Gallery of Data Visualization", 1991 

Have you ever seen voice mail? 
--- The Hackers Test 

Graphics is the visual means of resolving logical problems. 
--- Jacques Bertin 

The greatest value of a picture is when it forces us to notice what we 
never expected to see. 
--- John W. Tukey 

If one technique of data analysis were to be exalted above all others 
for its ability to be revealing to the mind in connection with each of 
many different models, there is little doubt which one would be chosen. 
The simple graph has brought more information to the data analyst's 
mind than any other device. It specializes in providing indications of 
unexpected phenomena. 
--- John W. Tukey 

Genius seems to consist merely in trueness of sight. 
--- Ralph Waldo Emerson, 1840 

The eye obeys exactly the action of the mind. 
--- Ralph Waldo Emerson, 1860 

Vision is the art of seeing things invisible. 
--- Johnathan Swift, 1711 

When there is no vision, the people perish. 
--- Proverbs 29:18 

If I can't picture it, I can't understand it. 
--- Albert Einstein 

And those who have insight will shine brightly like the brightness of 
the expanse of Heaven. 
--- Daniel 12:3 

The one thing that marks the true artist is a clear perception and a 
firm, bold hand, in distinction from that imperfect mental vision and 
uncertain truth which give up the feeble pictures and the lumpy statues 
of the mere artisans on canvas or in stone. 
--- Oliver Wendell Holmes (1860), The Professor at the Breakfast Table 
Ticknor and Fields, Boston, MA 

I like your motto: One picture is worth 1,000 denials. 
--- Ronald Reagan to White House News Photographers Assn, 18 May 1983 

With brush you paint the possibilities; with pens you scribe the 
probabilities; for in pictures we find insight; while in numbers find 
we strength. 
--- Forrest W. Young 

A graphic should not only show the leaves; it should show the branches 
as well as the entire tree. 
--- Jacques Bertin 

Tables are like cobwebs, like the sieve of Danaides; beautifully 
reticulated, orderly to look upon, but which will hold no conclusion. 
Tables are abstractions, and the object a most concrete one, so 
difficult to read the essence of. 
--- From Chartism by Thomas Carlyle (1840), Chapter II, Statistics 

A judicious man looks at Statistics, not to get knowledge, but to save 
himself from having ignorance foisted on him. 
--- Thomas Carlyle, Chartism Chapter II, Statistics 

Although geometrical representations of propositions in the 
thermodynamics of fluids are in general use and have done good service 
in disseminating clear notions in this science, yet they have by no 
means received the extension in respect to variety and generality of 
which they are capable. 
--- J. Willard Gibbs, Graphical Methods in the Thermodynamics of 
Fluids}, 1873 \citeyear{Gibbs:1873a 

Although we often hear that data speak for themselves, their voices can 
be soft and sly. 
--- Mosteller, Fienberg and Rourke, Beginning Statistics with Data 
Analysis 1983, Reading MA, p. 234 

Nocturne, of Chopin, so beautiful music. But few people will appreciate 
the music if I just show them the notes. Most of us need to listen to 
the music to understand how beautiful it is. But often that's how we 
present statistics; we just show the notes, we don't play the music. 
--- Hans Rosling, OECD World Forum, Istanbul, June 2007 

The greatest possibilities of visual display lie in vividness and 
inescapability of the intended message. A visual display can stop your 
mental flow in its tracks and make you think. A visual display can 
force you to notice what you never expected to see. 
--- John W. Tukey 

The purpose of [data] display is comparison (recognition of phenomena), 
not numbers ... The phenomena are the main actors, numbers are the 
supporting cast. 
--- John W. Tukey 

If an editor should print bad English he would lose his position. Many 
editors are using and printing bad methods of graphic presentation, but 
they hold their jobs just the same. 
--- W. C. Brinton, Graphic methods of presenting facts 1914, p. 3 

Around the turn of the century, Karl Pearson, an almost elemental force 
for more and better statistical thought in all areas of life, including 
with gusto, matters of social policy, was thinking and lecturing about 
graphical methods. But later in Pearson's life, and certainly in the 
careers of R. A. Fisher and the other great statistical minds of the 
first half of the century, there was a falling away of interest in 
graphics and an efflorescence of devotion to analytical mathematical 
methods. Indeed, for many years there was a contagious *snobbery* 
against so unpopular, vulgar and elementary a topic as graphics among 
academic statisticians and their students 
--- William Kruskal 

If statistical graphics, although born just yesterday, extends its 
reach every day, it is because it replaces long tables of numbers and 
it allows one not only to embrace at glance the series of phenomena, 
but also to signal the correspondences or anomalies, to find the 
causes, to identify the laws. 
--- Emile Cheysson, c. 1877 

Numbers have an important story to tell. They rely on you to give them 
a clear and convincing voice 
--- Stephen Few 

Visualizations act as a campfire around which we gather to tell stories 
--- Al Shalloway 

The purpose of visualization is insight, not pictures 
--- Ben Shneiderman 

I love taxonomies, categories, ways of dividing people into groups 
--- Gretchen Rubin 

Ballerinas are often divided into three categories: jumpers, turners 
and balancers 
--- Robert Gottlieb 

Mr. Funkhouser has made an extremely interesting and valuable 
contribution to the history of statistical method. I wish, however, 
that he could have added a warning, supported by horrid examples, of 
the evils of the graphical method unsupported by tables of figures. 
Both for accurate understanding, and particularly to facilitate the use 
of the same material by other people, it is essential that graphs 
should not be published by themselves, but only when supported by the 
tables which lead up to them. It would be an exceedingly good rule to 
forbid in any scientific periodical the publication of graphs 
unsupported by tables. 
--- John Maynard Keynes, review of Funkhouser for The Economic Journal 
http://www.jstor.org/stable/2224943 

Without data you are just another person with an opinion 
--- W. Edwards Deming 

Without a plot you are just a person missing a convincing argument 
--- Di Cook, 2016 

Whatever relates to extent and quantity may be represented by 
geometrical figures. Statistical projections which speak to the senses 
without fatiguing the mind, possess the advantage of fixing the 
attention on a great number of important facts. 
--- Alexander von Humboldt, , p. ciii 

Segnius irritant animos demissa per aures, Quam quae sunt oculus 
subjecta fidelibus (Roughly: What we hear excites the mind less than 
what we see) 
--- Horace 

You see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear. 
--- Sherlock Holmes, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (1890), "A 
Scandal in Bohemia", p. 162 

Every picture tells a story. 
--- Rod Stewart, 1971 

A picture is worth a ten thousand words. 
--- Fred R. Barnard, March 10 1927 in the advertising trade journal 
Printers Ink 

...But it is not always clear *which* 1000 words. 
--- John W. Tukey, 1973 

Un croquis vaut mieux qu'un long discours. Tr.: A good sketch is better 
than a long speech. 
--- Napoleon Bonaparte 

A picture is worth a thousand numbers. 
--- Anon 

Show me your flowcharts and conceal your tables, and I shall continue 
to be mystified. Show me your tables, and I won't usually need your 
flowcharts; they'll be obvious. 
--- Fred Brooks, The Mythical Man-Month 

Look here, upon this picture, and on this. 
--- Shakespeare, Hamlet 

I am only a picture-taster, the way others are wine- or tea-tasters. 
--- Bernard Berenson, Sunset and Twilight Harcourt, Brace & World, 1963 

Getting information from a table is like extracting sunlight from a 
cucumber. 
--- Farquhar & Farquhar, 1891} 

When a law is contained in figures, it is buried like metal in an ore; 
it is necessary to extract it.  This is the work of graphical 
representation. It points out the coincidences, the relationships 
between phenomena, their anomalies, and we have seen what a powerful 
means of control it puts in the hands of the statistician to verify new 
data, discover and correct errors with which they have been stained. 
--- Emile Cheysson, Les m\ethods de la statistique (1890), 34-35. 

[When] you see excellent graphics, find out how they were done. Borrow 
strength from demonstrated excellence.  The idea for information design 
is: Don't get it original, get it right. 
--- Edward Tufte 

Good design is obvious. Great design is transparent. 
--- Joe Sparano, graphic designer for Oxide Design Co. 

Content precedes design. Design in the absence of content is not 
design, it's decoration. 
--- Jeffrey Zeldman, web designer and entrepreneur 

Mankind is not a circle with a single center but an ellipse with two 
focal points of which facts are one and ideas the other. 
--- Victor Hugo 

So, Fabricius, I already have this: that the most true path of the 
planet [Mars] is an ellipse, which Durer also calls an oval, or 
certainly so close to an ellipse that the difference is insensible 
--- Johannes Kepler, 1605 

`Data! data!' he cried impatiently.  I can't make bricks without clay. 
--- Arthur Conan-Doyle, Adventures of Sherlock Holmes "The Copper 
Beeches" 

I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has 
data. 
--- Arthur Conan-Doyle, Adventures of Sherlock Holmes "A Scandal in 
Bohemia" 

This was an unexpected piece of luck. My data were coming more quickly 
than I could have reasonably hoped. 
--- Arthur Conan-Doyle, Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes, The Musgrave Ritual 

I have not all my facts yet, but I do not think there are any 
insuperable difficulties. Still, it is an error to argue in front of 
your data. You find yourself insensibly twisting them round to fit your 
theories. 
--- Arthur Conan-Doyle, His Last Bow, Wisteria Lodge 

It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. 
--- Sherlock Homes in Scandal in Bohemia 

The only thing we know for sure about a missing data point is that it 
is not there, and there is nothing that the magic of statistics can do 
do change that.  The best that can be managed is to estimate the extent 
to which missing data have influenced the inferences we wish to draw. 
--- Howard Wainer, 2009 

Big data can change the way social science is performed, but will not 
replace statistical common sense. 
--- Thomas Landsall-Welfare, "Nowcasting the mood of the nation," 
Significance v. 9(4), August 12, 2012, p. 28 

Baseball is ninety percent mental and the other half is physical. 
--- Yogi Berra 

Whenever I see an outlier, I never know whether to throw it away or 
patent it. 
--- Bert Gunter quoting a colleague, R-Help, 9/14/2015 

In God we trust. All others must bring data. 
--- W. Edwards Deming 

The combination of some data and an aching desire for an answer does 
not ensure that a reasonable answer can be extracted from a given body 
of data. 
--- John W. Tukey 

The plural of anecdote is not data. 
--- Roger Brinner 

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. 
--- Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Sonnets from the Portuguese 

Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can 
be counted counts. 
--- Albert Einstein 

Whenever you can, count. 
--- Francis Galton, quoted in Newman 

It is difficult to understand why statisticians commonly limit their 
inquiries to Averages, and do not revel in more comprehensive views. 
Their souls seem as dull to the charm of variety as that of the native 
of our flat English counties, whose retrospect of Switzerland was that, 
if its mountains could be thrown into its lakes, two nuisances would be 
got rid of at once. 
--- Francis Galton in Natural Inheritance 

Winwood Reade is good upon the subject. He remarks that, while the 
individual man is an insoluble puzzle, in the aggregate he becomes a 
mathematical certainty. You can, for example, never foretell what any 
one man will do, but you can say with precision what an average number 
will be up to. Individuals vary, but percentages remain constant. So 
says the statistician. 
--- Arthur Conan-Doyle, Sign of the Four 

If you put a buttock on a hot plate and another one on an ice cube, the 
average is good, but in reality your bottom is in trouble. 
--- Grigore Moisil 

The graphical method has considerable superiority for the exposition of 
statistical facts over the tabular. A heavy bank of figures is 
grievously wearisome to the eye, and the popular mind is as incapable 
of drawing any useful lessons from it as of extracting sunbeams from 
cucumbers. 
--- Arthur B. & Henry Farquhar (1891). Economic and Industrial 
Delusions 

Let it serve for table-talk. 
--- William Shakespeare. The Merchant of Venice, Act III, Sc. 5. 

I drink to the general joy o' the whole table. 
--- William Shakespeare. Macbeth, Act III, Sc. 4. 

Isolated facts, those that can only be obtained by rough estimate and 
that require development, can only be presented in memoires; but those 
that can be presented in a body, with details, and on whose accuracy 
one can rely, may be expounded in tables. 
--- E. Duvillard, M{e}moire sur le travail du Bureau de statistique 
1806; cited in

Exploratory data analysis can never be the whole story, but nothing 
else can serve as the foundation stone -- as the first step. 
--- John W. Tukey, EDA, 1977, p.3. 

The best thing about being a statistician is that you get to play in 
everyone's backyard. 
--- John W. Tukey 

Far better an approximate answer to the right question, which is often 
vague, than an exact answer to the wrong question, which can always be 
made precise. 
--- John W. Tukey, (1962), "The future of data analysis," Annals of 
Mathematical Statistics 33, 1-67. 

A bad answer to a good question may be far better than a good answer to 
a bad question. 
--- A graduate class, paraphrasing Tukeys dictum. 

The worst, i.e., most dangerous, feature of 'accepting the null 
hypothesis' is the giving up of explicit uncertainty ... Mathematics 
can sometimes be put in such black-and-white terms, but our knowledge 
or belief about the external world never can. 
--- John W. Tukey. (1991). "The Philosophy of Multiple Comparisons," 
Statistical Science 6, 100--116. 

Better to have an approximate answer to the right question than a 
precise answer to the wrong question. 
--- John W. Tukey as quoted by John Chambers 

The combination of some data and an aching desire for an answer does 
not ensure that a reasonable answer can be extracted from a given body 
of data. 
--- John W. Tukey 

The practical power of a statistical test is the product of its' 
statistical power and the probability of use. 
--- John W. Tukey, 1959
