## Release Summary

This is the sixth CRAN release of tidytext. In this release, I updated tidiers and casters to align with the quanteda v1.0 API and fixed bugs related to consistency in input/output classes and `NA` value handling.

## Test environments
* Local OS X install, R 3.4.2
* Ubuntu 14.04 (on Travis-CI), R 3.4.2
* Win-builder (devel and release)
* r-hub using `check_on_windows()`
