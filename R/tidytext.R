#' tidytext: Text Mining using 'dplyr', 'ggplot2', and Other Tidy Tools
#'
#' This package implements tidy data principles to make many text mining tasks easier,
#' more effective, and consistent with tools already in wide use.
#'
#' Much of the infrastructure needed for text mining with tidy data frames
#' already exists in packages like dplyr, broom, tidyr and ggplot2.
#'
#' In this package, we provide functions and supporting data sets to allow conversion
#' of text to and from tidy formats, and to switch seamlessly between tidy tools
#' and existing text mining packages.
